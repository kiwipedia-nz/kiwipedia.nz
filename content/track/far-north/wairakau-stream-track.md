Beautiful medium grade track close to Whangaroa harbour, takes you trough native forrest, valley, couple of stream crossing to a DOC hut on sea shore.

<!--more-->

The start of the track is at the end of Campbell road at Totara North. You can leave you car parked there and start climbing up steep and after rain pretty muddy old farm road. After 20 minutes you'll see a sign to Wairaka stream. Descent through native forrest to lovely valley with stream where you will need to cross it couple of times (crossings are shallow but there are great swimming holes too).

Keep going until you reach the DOC hut but don't get in if you didn't book it - you will find toilet close by. Now you can either go back, continue to Duke's Nose (only for fit people as it involves a real rock climbing with ropes up to 30 metres) or you could book a water taci and enjoy nice ride trough Whangaroa harbour back to Totara North.
