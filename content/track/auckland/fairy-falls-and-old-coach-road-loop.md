A little bit longer (but still ideal for families or after work run/walk) loop track created from Fairy Falls track and Old Coach road track.

<!--more-->

You can start either from Scenic drive or for Mountain road. If you park your car on Scenic drive and you rather walk up the falls then take the Old Coach road track first and then come back through Fairy Falls tracks. Or park on Mountain road and do first the Fairy Falls and then come back via Old Coach road track. It's all up to you but I guess it's better to see the waterfalls on return rather then as a first attraction :)

Don't forget then you can also use the Goodfellow track to shorten the loop if you wish to.
