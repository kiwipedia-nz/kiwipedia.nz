Two beautiful waterfalls just 40 minutes drive from Auckland - perfect spot for picnic or swim.

<!--more-->

Just head to Bethells beach but turn right to Horsman road and continue till very end where is little carpark (could be really full especially on sunny days so be prepared to carefully park along the road). There are no tilets or other facilities at the carpark.

The track to falls is well maintained by DOC and after 30 minutes walking through young Kauri and Kanuka/Manuka forest you end up on top viewing platform from where you can see the Mokoroa Falls.
There is set of timber steps you can take to get down to the bottom of falls where you can finely see the Houheria falls.

The lagoon at the bottom of walls is not very suitable for swimming but you can follow the stream and you'll find perfect swimming hole with little cascade.
From here you can return the same direction back tpo carpark or follow the stream further via Mokoroa Stream track and return back through Goldie bush Walkway.
