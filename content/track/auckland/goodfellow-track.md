This short but beautiful track connects Fairy Falls track and Old Couch road - both roughly in middle of their length.

Its well formed and reasonably dry, with two steeper areas with timber steps. It takes you through native bush and little stream crossing, up couple of natural stone steps in the rock wall and further up the ridge with tall groups of big Kauri trees with great views to surrounding hills of Waitakere ranges.

It's a perfect way to make a loop from Fairy Falls track - from either Mountain road or Scenic drive.
