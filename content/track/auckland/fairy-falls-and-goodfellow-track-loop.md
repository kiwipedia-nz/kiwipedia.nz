An ideal 1 hour long loop walk along stream, waterfalls and through the kauri forrest with great views.

<!--more-->

Park at the little carpark on Mountain road - take care when driving as the road is windy and narrow - at some time there is just one lane for both directions. The preferred way is to head to Fairy Falls first, then climb all steps up along the stream and water halls and somewhere in the middle of Fairy Falls track turn right to Goodfellow track.

The walk will take you slightly down and then through couple of series of steps up to ridge where you can enjoy great view to Auckland CBD and surrounding hills. At the end of the Goodfellow track turn right to Old Coach Road and descend back to carpark. This part of trek can be bit muddy so watch your steps.
