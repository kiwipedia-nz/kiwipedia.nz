A great track with fair amount of steps - perfect in summer when you can cool down in one of many swimming holes.

<!--more-->

You can start either from the Scenic drive road and then go down to the bottom of waterfall and then walk up back again.

Or you can drive up narrow and windy Mountain road and walk up to base of the waterfall from the other side (recomended option). The track from here is well-formed but you would need to cross shallow stream few times (you can usually cross without getting wet). You will be rewarded with lovely native New Zealand bush with Nikau palms and couple of Kauri trees.

You can make this track a loop and return via Old Couch Road track or go through Goodfellow track when climb all steps up.
