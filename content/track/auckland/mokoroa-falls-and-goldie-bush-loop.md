<!--more-->

It's 40 minutes drive from Auckland CBD and when you are getting closer the road becomes windier and narrower, then it turns to gravel for couple of kilometres. At the end of Horsman road there is a little carpark with no facilities. get on Mokoroa Falls track which goes steadily down through lovely native forrest, after 20 minutes of walk you end up on the viewing platform - you can take great pictures of the main Mokoroa Falls from here. But there is another smaller waterfall just under your feet. So take the steps down and enjoy great view of both waterfalls in the little canyon.

Then follow the stream which you will need to cross several times on your way down. There are some beautiful swimming holes you can enjoy to dip in. After another 20 minutes you will arrive to walking bridge, turn left, cross the bridge and continue climbing up via the Goldi Bush walkaway. in 30 minutes you will again end up on Mokora Falls track, so just turn right and get back to carpark.
